# TM_SDK_TEMPLATE

## If you are just looking around and don't know what it is, don't waste your time. It will be useless for you anyway.

To create a new project, click `Use this template->Create a new repository`.
To use it in already existing project, you can download the code by clicking `Code->Download ZIP`, but remember to setup submodule later on.

Remember to respect the LICENSE.

Consider forking `TM_SDK` and use it as your submodule. You will be able to make changes quickly and PR them later when you want them to be merged.

To rename the project, run `init.bat` and input your project name. Make sure that you have `python` installed beforehand.
